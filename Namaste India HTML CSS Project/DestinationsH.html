					<h4>Taj Mahal & Fatehpur Sikri, Agra, Uttar Pradesh</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, the creator of the Taj Mahal, said that the beauty of the monument 
					made “the sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes”. It has also been described as a 
					“teardrop on the cheek of eternity” by Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Every year, 
					thousands of tourists from around the world make a beeline for this breathtakingly ethereal 
					marble monument, considerd by many as the most beautiful building constructed by man. 
					The monument was built as a memorial by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his deceased wife, 
					Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the seven wonders of the world and is a monument of pride for not 
					just Agra but also India. <br>
					
					Mughal emperor Akbar built his capital at Fatehpur Sikri between 1572 and 1585 AD. 
					It was constructed using red sandstone. It is said that the emperor, who wished for a son, 
					went to Sikri to get blessed by sufi saint, Sheikh Salim Chishti. He was soon blessed with a 
					son and was prompted to establish his capital here, building a beautiful mosque and three 
					palaces, one each for his three favourite wives. He named the city Fatehpur Sikri, meaning 
					the city of victory. He also named his son Salim, after the saint who had blessed him.

					<h4>Qutub Minar, Delhi</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					Almost as old as the history of the Delhi Sultanate, the iconic Qutub Minar, the world's 
					tallest brick minaret, dominates the skyline of the city. Standing 73 foot tall, this 
					five-storeyed tower, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, remains one of the most magnificent 
					buildings of India from the medieval era. The first three storeys of the tower are built in 
					red sandstone while the fourth and fifth are made of marble and sandstone. All the five floors 
					are adorned with projecting balconies.

					Located in Delhi's Mehrauli area, the Qutub Minar was commissioned by Qutub-ud-din Aibak, 
					who laid the foundation of Mamluk dynasty (1206-1290) in India. Inspired by the victory tower at 
					Ghazni, Afghanistan, its construction began in 1192 AD but, unfortunately, Qutub-ud-din-Aibak, 
					did not live long enough to witness its completion. The tower was finally completed by his 
					successors Iltutmish and Firoz Shah Tughlaq.
					
					Another attraction here is the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque that stands right next to the minaret. 
					Constructed by Qutub-ud-din-Aibak, the mosque is considered to be the first building in the 
					Qutub complex that houses a number of monuments. One of the most popular among these is the 
					Iron Pillar, also known as the Ashoka Pillar, which dates back to the 4th century.

					<h4>Hampi, Karnataka</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					A legendary lost city that was once the powerhouse of an ancient kingdom and an auspicious 
					temple town standing on the banks of the mighty Tungabhadra river, history and mythology come 
					to life in Hampi, Karnataka. A queen's bath, a spectacular Lotus Palace, a royal stable or a 
					temple, which is said to have been the place where the wedding of Lord Shiva and Goddess 
					Parvati took place, this UNESCO World Heritage site reveals a facet of history at every turn.

					Albeit in ruins, the magnificent structures here stand in testimony to Hampi's rich past under 
					the powerful Vijayanagara empire (1336 – 1646 AD). Hampi finds mention in the Hindu epic Ramayana 
					as well. It is said to be the location of the monkey kingdom, Kishkindha. No wonder then that 
					Hampi has ranked second in the must-visit destination list for the year 2019 by the New York Times! 
					The grandiose site of Hampi was the last capital of the Vijayanagara kingdom, one of the most 
					significant in southern India. Its rich kings built exquisite temples and palaces, which won the 
					admiration of travellers between the 14th and 16th centuries. Though plundered later, Hampi still 
					retains more than 1,600 monuments, including palaces, forts, memorial structures, temples, shrines, 
					pillared halls, baths and gateways.

					<h4>Sun Temple, Odisha</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					Dedicated to Surya or the Sun God and designed like his chariot, the massive and magnificent 
					Sun Temple at Konark (kona meaning angle and ark referring to the sun) is one of the finest 
					examples of ancient Indian architectural heritage. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, 
					the breathtakingly splendid temple was once described by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore 
					as the place where the language of stone surpasses the language of man. Situated around 30 km 
					from Puri, the temple, seemingly rising from the depths of the sea, is just 2 km away from the 
					Bay of Bengal coastline. Built in the 13th century by Ganga king Narasimhadeva I, 
					the temple with stunning sculptural details, marks the most evolved period in the Kalinga 
					architecture. It is said that the temple was designed in such a way that the rising sun's 
					first rays would illuminate the deul (sanctuary) and the presiding deity. The temple stands 
					on a base of a total of 24 intricately carved wheels, 12 on each side. Four of the 24 wheels 
					can be used as sundials to tell the time!
					According to experts, the temple was used for prayers only for a short period and in the 17th 
					century, the presiding deity may have been moved to Jagannath Temple in Puri.

					<h4>Khajuraho, Madhya Pradesh</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					If stones could speak, the Khajuraho temples would create melodies! Situated in Madhya Pradesh 
					and cradled by the Vindhya mountain range, the heritage town of Khajuraho is famed for being 
					home to the UNESCO World Heritage Site listed temple complex that features Hindu and 
					Jain houses of worship. These temples are famous for their stunning intricate sculptures 
					depicting different aspects of life: spirituality, love, friendship, sports, royalty and 
					most significantly, awe-inspiring art. Based on their geographical location, the temples 
					are categorised into three groups: Eastern, Western and Southern. Believed to have been 
					built in a relatively short period of time spanning over 100 years, i.e. between 950-1050 AD, 
					the complex boasts 22 temple structures that remain from the initial group of 85. 
					Forgotten for centuries, they were rediscovered in the 1850s and restored. 

					The temples were conceived and built under the rule of the Chandela dynasty. 
					The ornate craftsmanship transforms the life-like sculptures on the temple walls into works 
					of art and is an ode to life, love and joy.

					<h4>Ajanta & Ellora, Maharashtra</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					Located about 107 km from Aurangabad, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Ajanta Caves are a 
					famous cluster of 32 Buddhist caves. The rock-hewn caves at Ajanta are either chaityas 
					(shrine), chapels or prayer halls, or viharas (monasteries) or residential cells.

					Caves 9 and 10 are chaityas, which contain the earliest known remnants of paintings in India. 
					Caves 19, 26 and 29 are chaityas of the Mahayana period and all the other caves are viharas. 
					Ajanta displays the Gandhara and Mathura schools of art from the Kushana period; the Sarnath 
					school of art from the Gupta period; and the Amaravati school of art from the late Satavahana 
					and Ikshvaku periods.
					<br>
					Ellora, considered the finest examples of rock-cut architecture, comprises  Hindu, 
					Buddhist and Jain caves that were chiselled between the 4th and the 9th century. 
					Of the 34 caves, 12 are Buddhist, 17 Hindu and 5 Jain, and date back to the Rashtrakuta 
					dynasty, about 1,500 years ago. They were declared a World Heritage Site in 1983, and are 
					now maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

					<h4>Hill Forts of Rajasthan, Rajasthan</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					The serial site, situated in the state of Rajastahan, includes six majestic forts in 
					Chittorgarh; Kumbhalgarh; Sawai Madhopur; Jhalawar; Jaipur, and Jaisalmer. 
					The ecclectic architecture of the forts, some up to 20 kilometres in circumference, 
					bears testimony to the power of the Rajput princely states that flourished in the region 
					from the 8th to the 18th centuries. Enclosed within defensive walls are major urban centres, 
					palaces, trading centres and other buildings including temples that often predate the 
					fortifications within which developed an elaborate courtly culture that supported learning, 
					music and the arts. Some of the urban centres enclosed in the fortifications have survived, 
					as have many of the site's temples and other sacred buildings. The forts use the natural 
					defenses offered by the landscape: hills, deserts, rivers, and dense forests. 
					They also feature extensive water harvesting structures, largely still in use today.

					<h4>Mahabalipuram Shore, Tamil Nadu</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					Sitting along the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, the seaport town of Mamallapuram or 
					Mahabalipuram, in Tamil Nadu, is a beautiful beach destination that is slowly becoming the 
					surfing hub of the country. Speckled with several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, courtesy of 
					the ancient Pallava dynasty (3rd - 9th century BC), who were great patrons of art and crafts, 
					Mamallapuram holds a baffling visual treat around every corner. Its awe-inspiring cave temples, 
					sculptures and monuments leave one marvelling at the skill of the craftsmen of that time. With 
					its striking bas reliefs and rock-cut temples, Mamallapuram is practically an open-air museum. 
					Many of the temples, built with granite, relate the stories from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. 
					Once a thriving port, Mamallapuram is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site complex, also famous 
					for its seashell jewellery, seafood, cafes and markets and a breathtaking ocean-front. 
					While you can soak in history visiting various historical sites, Mamallapuram's pristine 
					beaches fringed by lush groves with a warm sun, invite surfers.  With perfect sea waves 
					between June and September, the beaches host surfing training sessions conducted by experts.

					<h4>Chola Temple, Tamil Nadu</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					The Great Living Chola Temples were built by kings of the Chola Empire, which stretched over 
					all of south India and the neighbouring islands. The three great 11th- and 
					12th-century Temples: the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, the Brihadisvara Temple at 
					Gangaikondacholisvaram and the Airavatesvara Temple at Darasuram. The Temple of 
					Gangaikondacholisvaram, built by Rajendra I, was completed in 1035. Its 53-m vimana 
					(sanctum tower) has recessed corners and a graceful upward curving movement, 
					contrasting with the straight and severe tower at Thanjavur. The Airavatesvara temple complex, 
					built by Rajaraja II, at Darasuram features a 24-m vimana and a stone image of Shiva. 
					The temples testify to the brilliant achievements of the Chola in architecture, sculpture, 
					painting and bronze casting. The great Cholas established a powerful monarchy in the 9th CE 
					at Thanjavur and in its surroundings. They enjoyed a long, eventful rule lasting for four and 
					a half centuries with great achievements in all fields of royal endeavour such as military 
					conquest, efficient administration, cultural assimilation and promotion of art.

					<h4>Kaziranga National Park, Assam</h4>
					<br><hr><br>
					<p>
					One of the greatest wildlife emblems of the country, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of 
					Kaziranga National Park, is famed as a home to two-thirds of the world's population of 
					the rare one-horned rhinoceros. With the mighty Brahmaputra river lapping at the fringes, 
					the park encompasses wetlands, forests and grasslands, which shelter a sizeable population 
					of tigers as well. Moreover, the park is an abode of world-famous snakes - the rock python, 
					the reticulated python and the king cobra, the longest venomous snake.

					While eastern swamp deer and wild water buffalo are common sights, if you're lucky, 
					you can also spot a herd of elephants making their way grandly through the park. 
					One of the key attractions of the park are the 4WD safaris that help you explore 
					the park better.
					
					Located in the heart of Assam, the park was formed in 1908 on the recommendation of Mary 
					Curzon, the wife of the then viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston. It is an important 
					area for migratory birds and also houses the endangered Ganges river dolphin.

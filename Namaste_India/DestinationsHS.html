				<h3>Gulmarg, Jammu & Kashmir</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
				With rolling green meadows carpeted by bushes of wild flowers blending into snow-clad mountains, 
				whose peaks peep into the clouds, and mountain streams rushing by, Gulmarg is sheer poetry in 
				nature. While this is the summer landscape of this tiny hamlet in Jammu and Kashmir, in winter, 
				it is transformed into a white wonderland, with skiers making a beeline for its famous slopes. 
				The scenic valley of Gulmarg is a little piece of paradise cocooned by the mighty snow-clad 
				mountains of the Pir Panjal range. Emerald green meadows, deep ravines and pine-forested hills 
				make this meadow of flowers (the meaning of Gulmarg) an ethereal sight that has inspired poets 
				and artists for centuries.
				Located only 52 km from Srinagar, Gulmarg sits at an altitude of 2,730 m above sea level, 
				and gets completely covered in snow during winter. This makes it a hub of winter adventure sports 
				like snowboarding, heli-skiing (skiing down a mountain after being taken up by a helicopter), 
				off-piste skiing (skiing on unconventional ski runs) etc. Its slopes have been declared as the 
				7th best for skiing in Asia.

				<h3>Shimla & Manali, Himachal Pradesh</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
				Enveloped in mist, nestled within dense forests and silhouetted against snowy peaks of the mighty 
				Himalayas, Shimla is a paradise in the hills. From its British-era lodges that take you back to 
				the old-world to the bustling 12-km-long Ridge, the heartbeat of the city, Shimla, 
				in Himachal Pradesh, is among the most popular hill stations in India. Ringed by seven lofty hills, 
				Shimla is an ideal summer holiday destination and equally popular in winter, when a blanket of snow 
				covers it. An ideal getaway to experience thrilling and adrenaline-pumping sports like skiing, 
				trekking, paragliding and ice skating, Shimla has one of the oldest golf courses in the country.
				<br>
				The magnetic town of Manali beckons to the soul of adventurers, nature lovers as well as 
				solace-seekers. Nestled in the Himalayas, in the north Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, 
				Manali is a charming hill station. A part of the northern end of the Kullu Valley, 
				it is situated by the Beas river at a height of 1,926 m above sea level. Floral meadows, 
				gurgling streams, snow-capped mountains, lofty mountain passes, temples and Buddhist monasteries 
				give this tiny town the allure of a fairy-tale setting.

				<h3>Nainital & Mussoorie, Uttarakhand</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
				Nainital, British India's favourite summer vacation spot, is a popular hill station located in 
				the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. Many believe that the area was reminiscent of the Cumbrian Lake 
				district in England and thus led the homesick Englishmen to flock to Nainital. 
				Today, while the bustling town, perched on a mountain top in the Great Himalayas, 
				may have increased in size, with its high-rises mingling with colonial-style bungalows, 
				it retains its old-world charm. Situated at a height of 1,938 m, Nainital was once a domain of 
				60 lakes, the most important being the Naini Lake, around which the town grew.
				<br>
				A very popular summer getaway, the quaint hill station of Mussoorie, in Uttarakhand, 
				remains shrouded in mist, and when it clears, it reveals a delightful view of the snow-capped 
				Himalayas and the green Doon Valley. Fondly referred to as the queen of hill stations, 
				Mussoorie's landscape boasts spectacular natural sights such as waterfalls and hills, 
				and also invites adventure lovers and thrill seekers to explore its terrain with paragliding, 
				trekking, camping etc.

				<h3>Matheran, Maharashtra</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
				When in Mumbai, you can head to one of India's smallest and most quaint hill stations, Matheran, 
				for a quick weekend getaway. One of the coolest spots in the Karjat Tahsil, 
				Raigad District of Maharashtra, it is located in the Western Ghats. 
				Matheran literally means forest on top or woodland overhead and the name aptly fits the 
				800-m-high hill town. The interesting thing about Matheran is that vehicles are banned here and 
				one can easily be transported to the quaintness and peace of times long ago while vacationing at 
				this spot. It's proximity to major cities makes it a more viable option.

				It lies about 90 km from Mumbai, 120 km from Pune and about 320 km from Surat. 
				This pocket in the hills was discovered in 1850 by the then British Collector of Thane, 
				Huge Mallet.
				The Kalavantin Durg or Fort near Matheran is a perfect day time trek option. 
				You can lose yourself in the wilderness of the fort, which is located at an elevation of over 
				2,000 ft. The most striking aspect of this ancient structure is the series of rock-cut steps 
				that snake up to the top. The panoramic view from the pinnacle has to be seen to be believed.

				literally means three rivers. During the blooming season, every 12 years, the town of Munnar is 
				transmogrified into an artist's canvas, when the beautiful and vibrant Neelakurinji flower carpets 
				the land in hues of purple and blue. It is truly a sight to behold as the town acquires a
